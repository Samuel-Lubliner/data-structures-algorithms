# Introduction to Algorithms

Algorithm: set  of  instructions  for  accomplishing  a  task.

## Big  O  run  times sorted from fastest to slowest:

- O(log n)
  - also  known  as  log  time
  - Binary  search
- O(n)
  - linear  time
  - Simple  search
- O(n  *  log  n)
  - A  fast  sorting  algorithm
  - quicksort
- O(n2)
  - A    slow    sorting    algorithm
  - selection sort
- O(n!)
  - A   really   slow   algorithm

## Logarithm Review

Logs are the inverse of exponentiation.

10^2 = 100 == log10(100) = 2
10^3 = 1000 == log10(1000) = 3
2^3 = 8 == log2(8) = 3
2^4 = 16 == log2(16) = 4
2^5 = 32 == log2(32) = 5
